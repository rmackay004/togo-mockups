# Multi-Agent Workflows in ToGo

## Overview

ToGo leverages a sophisticated multi-agent architecture to automate administrative tasks, reduce clinician burnout, and optimize hospital workforce management. The system employs three distinct workflow patterns, each designed for different levels of human oversight and intervention.

---

## Three Workflow Types

### 1. Autonomous Agents (No Human Intervention)

**Definition**: Agents that operate completely independently, making decisions and executing tasks without requiring human approval or oversight.

**Use Cases**:
- **Timesheet Agent**: Automatically tracks work hours from shift data and submits timesheets on schedule
- **Documentation Agent**: Files clinical notes and administrative documents to appropriate systems
- **Reminder Agent**: Sends notifications for upcoming shifts, credential renewals, and training deadlines
- **Email Categorization Agent**: Sorts and prioritizes incoming communications

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✓ High confidence, low-risk tasks
- ✓ Rules-based decision making with clear boundaries
- ✓ Immediate execution
- ✓ Audit trail maintained for compliance
- ✓ Operates 24/7 without supervision

**Visual Indicators**:
- Green color scheme (#10B981)
- Checkmark icon (✓)
- "Completed • No action needed" status badges
- Real-time activity feed updates

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Clinician completes shift at hospital
2. Timesheet Agent detects shift completion via rostering system
3. Agent calculates hours worked (including breaks, overtime)
4. Agent cross-references with organizational policies
5. Agent auto-submits timesheet to payroll system
6. Agent notifies clinician of submission
7. No human intervention required
```

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop (Requires Approval)

**Definition**: Agents that perform analysis and prepare recommendations, but require explicit human approval before executing actions.

**Use Cases**:
- **Credential Verification Agent**: Reviews license renewals and flags issues, but waits for clinician to approve document uploads
- **Shift Swap Agent**: Identifies optimal shift swap candidates based on skills/availability, but requires both parties to approve
- **LMS Recommendation Agent**: Suggests learning courses based on clinical cases and career goals, but clinician chooses which to enroll in
- **Compliance Alert Agent**: Detects potential policy violations and suggests corrective actions, but requires approval before implementation

**Key Characteristics**:
- ⏸ Medium-risk decisions requiring human judgment
- ⏸ Agent presents options with supporting data
- ⏸ Clear approval/reject mechanisms
- ⏸ Explanation of recommendation logic
- ⏸ Time-bound approval windows

**Visual Indicators**:
- Orange color scheme (#F59E0B)
- Pause/review icon (⏸)
- "Pending your approval" status badges
- Action buttons: "Approve" and "Reject"
- Countdown timers for time-sensitive approvals

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Clinician's RN license expires in 45 days
2. Credential Agent detects upcoming expiration
3. Agent pre-fills renewal application with existing data
4. Agent uploads supporting documents from file system
5. Agent presents completed application to clinician
6. Clinician reviews, makes corrections if needed
7. Clinician clicks "Approve & Submit"
8. Agent submits to regulatory authority
9. Agent tracks submission status
```

### 3. Human-on-the-Loop (Agent Acts, Human Monitors)

**Definition**: Agents that take immediate action but notify humans for monitoring and potential intervention. Humans can override or adjust after the fact.

**Use Cases**:
- **Schedule Optimization Agent**: Automatically fills open shifts based on availability, skills, and preferences, but allows admin to modify
- **EMR Briefing Agent**: Pre-populates shift briefings from electronic medical records, but clinician can request more details
- **Emergency Coverage Agent**: Automatically contacts on-call staff for urgent shift coverage, but admin monitors responses
- **Compliance Documentation Agent**: Auto-generates required compliance reports, but quality assurance team reviews periodically

**Key Characteristics**:
- ⚡ Time-sensitive actions where delay is costly
- ⚡ Agent acts first, human reviews afterward
- ⚡ Override and rollback capabilities
- ⚡ Monitoring dashboards with alert thresholds
- ⚡ Audit logs for accountability

**Visual Indicators**:
- Blue color scheme (#3B82F6)
- Lightning bolt icon (⚡)
- "Active • Monitor" status badges
- "View Details" or "Override" action buttons
- Notification badges for actions requiring review

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Overnight shift in ICU becomes vacant (nurse calls in sick)
2. Emergency Coverage Agent immediately activates
3. Agent queries staff database for qualified RNs
4. Agent filters by: ICU certification, availability, proximity, recent hours
5. Agent sends SMS to top 3 candidates simultaneously
6. First responder auto-confirmed for shift
7. Agent updates roster and notifies department
8. Admin receives notification of auto-fill
9. Admin can review and modify if needed
10. If no response in 15 min, agent escalates to next tier
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Coordination Between Agents

ToGo's agents don't operate in isolation—they collaborate and share context:

**Example: New Shift Assignment Cascade**
1. **Schedule Optimization Agent** assigns clinician to new shift (Human-on-the-Loop)
2. **EMR Briefing Agent** automatically pulls patient data for that shift (Autonomous)
3. **LMS Recommendation Agent** suggests relevant training based on patient conditions (Human-in-the-Loop)
4. **Reminder Agent** schedules pre-shift notifications (Autonomous)
5. **Timesheet Agent** prepares to track hours for new shift (Autonomous)

### Orchestrator Agent

The **Orchestrator Agent** serves as the "conductor" of the multi-agent system:
- Coordinates task handoffs between specialized agents
- Resolves conflicts when agents have competing priorities
- Manages shared resources (API rate limits, database connections)
- Monitors system health and agent performance
- Routes exceptions to appropriate human reviewers
