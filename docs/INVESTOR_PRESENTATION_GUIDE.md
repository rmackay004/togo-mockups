## Handling Investor Questions

### Expected Questions & Suggested Answers

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage if Epic or Oracle decides to build this?"**

A: "Great question. Three reasons we win:
1. **Focus**: We're 100% dedicated to workforce + AI. Epic is focused on clinical workflows, not HR/scheduling.
2. **Speed**: We have a 3-5 year head start with proven components. Large vendors move slowly.
3. **Best-of-breed integration**: Hospitals want flexibility, not lock-in. We integrate with Epic's EMR rather than compete with it."

---

**Q: "How defensible is the AI? Can competitors just use ChatGPT?"**

A: "The AI isn't the moat—the orchestration is. Anyone can call an LLM API, but we've built:
- Healthcare-specific workflow patterns (autonomous vs. human-in-loop)
- Agent coordination logic (how 15 agents work together without conflicts)
- Compliance guardrails (HIPAA, state nursing regulations)
- Integration depth (EMR, LMS, credential systems)

That's 2+ years of healthcare domain expertise encoded into the system."

---

**Q: "What's the regulatory risk? What if HIPAA changes?"**

A: "We're building on established healthcare infrastructure (FHIR standards, SOC 2, HIPAA compliance from day one). Regulatory changes are actually an advantage—we adapt the platform once, all customers benefit. Hospitals building in-house have to update their own systems."

---

**Q: "Why do you need to raise $15M? Isn't this just connecting APIs?"**

A: "Fair challenge. Here's the investment breakdown:
- **Enterprise-grade security**: HIPAA compliance isn't free (SOC 2 audit, pen testing, encryption infrastructure)
- **Integration complexity**: EMR integrations require Epic/Cerner certification programs ($500k each)
- **Agent development**: Each specialized agent requires clinical workflow validation (work with nurse users)
- **Enterprise sales**: Hospital sales cycles are 3-6 months, need experienced AEs with healthcare relationships
- **Customer success**: Healthcare customers need white-glove onboarding and support

This is enterprise B2B healthcare, not consumer SaaS. The CAC and sales cycle justify the investment."

---

**Q: "What's the revenue split from the three integrated companies?"**

A: "Structure is TBD, but envision:
- **Equity stake**: Med App, Core Schedule, myhealthPD each get equity in Togo Health (5-10% depending on revenue contribution)
- **Revenue share**: They continue to earn revenue from their existing customer base on their legacy platforms
- **Transition incentive**: Bonus for successful customer migrations to unified Togo Health platform
- **Unified pricing**: Togo Health bundles all three + AI for one price, we distribute revenue internally

This aligns everyone on building the best unified product."

---

**Q: "How do you prevent customer churn once they're using AI agents?"**

A: "AI agents create three types of lock-in:
1. **Workflow dependency**: Once timesheet agent is auto-submitting, going back to manual is painful
2. **Data moats**: Agent recommendations improve with usage data (switching means losing that intelligence)
3. **Integration investment**: EMR integration + SSO + user training = high switching costs

Plus, we measure wellbeing impact. If we can prove 28% burnout reduction to hospital CNOs, they won't churn—clinician retention is their #1 problem."

---

**Q: "What's the path to $100M ARR?"**

A: "Math:
- **Year 1**: 15 hospitals × $150k ACV = $2.25M ARR
- **Year 2**: 60 hospitals × $175k ACV (upsells) = $10.5M ARR
- **Year 3**: 200 hospitals × $200k ACV = $40M ARR
- **Year 4**: 400 hospitals × $250k ACV = $100M ARR

Assumes:
- 30% of 6,000 US hospitals are viable targets (250+ beds)
- 22% market penetration in 4 years
- 25% ACV growth from upsells (more agents, more features)
- 90% gross retention, 120% net retention"
